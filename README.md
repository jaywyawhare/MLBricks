# MLBricks

MLBricks is a open-source machine learning project with the goal of creating a Scratch-like visual programming interface for machine learning. As a single developer, my mission is to simplify the process of building machine learning models, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced data scientists.

## Features

- **Visual Programming**: MLBricks allows users to drag and drop blocks to design and execute machine learning workflows, just like Scratch for coding. No more complex code writing; create models graphically.

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed with simplicity in mind, MLBricks is perfect for newcomers to machine learning, enabling them to experiment with ML models without prior coding experience.

- **Extensible**: I'm working to make MLBricks extensible, allowing advanced users to access and edit generated code, providing flexibility and customization options while still benefiting from the visual interface.


## Contributing
While I'm currently the sole developer behind MLBricks, I welcome any contributions from the community. Your support, feedback, and ideas are highly valued and can help make this project even better.
